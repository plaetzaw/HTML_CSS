<p class="silver">No matter how many times I've watched this race, I'm always shocked by how Phelps managed to get it done here. The out-touch was by less than a fingernail.
<br>
It still blows my mind to this day.</p>

<h1>#2 The Once and Again Champion</h1>

<p class="silver">Anthony Ervin won the gold medal in the 50 free in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Despite age and many adversities, he returned to the top of the sport
and stuck gold again in the Rio 50 free final.</p>

<h1>The Most Legendary Shit I ever had spoiled for me because of tape delay</h1>

12 YEARS LATER, AND NO ON HAS MATCHED THAT SPLIT OF 46.06</p>
<br>
Thank you for indulging me in my nerdiness.
